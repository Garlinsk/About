 <P>
  My name are Franklin Kuloba,male and a student at Moringa school.
  I finished my high school studies in the year 2014,
  managed to score a C+ plus in my final year exams.
  I never joined  campus or any other institution of higher education.
  From then i decided to venture into hustle,just doing any casual job
  so that i could make end meets.
 </P>
 <p>In the process of hustling i did a number of casual jobs here and there ,
  <em>there was a time i sold second hands cloths,commonly called <b>"mitumba
  clothes"</b>,i did a couple of things and
  at some point i was a trainer</em>,i trained both children and adults how to
  skate.For a while it had been my source of income until i started managing a
  friend's business,commonly known "Movie shop."
 </p>
 <p>My hobbies are <ul>
   <li>skating</li>
   <li>i like movies especially the science fictions</li>
<li>  i like everything about computer,computing and all the tech things</li></ul>
I can say iam passionate about programming "coding",that i have been watching
  videos about programming and at some point i tried to that but i had no clue
  of what i was doing,joining  coding sites <a href="https://www.github.com">,
  joing git hub </a>,free code camp and for
  sure i loved the experience that i decided to look for a way to learn.Thats
  why joined "<b>Moringa School</b>"
